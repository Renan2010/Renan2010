I'm a Brazilian developer and science enthusiast. As an AuDHD developer, I'm deeply passionate about understanding systems at their core and optimizing everything for maximum performance. This passion led me to create **[RenuxOS](https://github.com/RenuxTeam/renuxos-src)** and found the **[RenuxTeam](https://github.com/RenuxTeam)** organization.

I also love to **innovate** and explore everything related to the **tech world**, from low-level systems to high-level tools and futuristic technologies.

I develop software using **smart pointers**, always aiming for **safe, reliable, and efficient** solutions. üòé

I also love to **fork** projects, fixing bugs, improving performance, and adding cool new features.  
I believe that improving existing software is just as important as creating something from scratch! üîßüöÄ

My main focus is on operating system development, low-level performance, and creating tools for the Linux ecosystem.
