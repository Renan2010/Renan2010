I'm a Brazilian developer and science enthusiast. As an AuDHD developer, I'm deeply passionate about understanding systems at their core and optimizing everything for maximum performance. This passion led me to create **[RenuxOS](https://github.com/RenuxTeam/RenuxOS)** and found the **[RenuxTeam](https://github.com/RenuxTeam)** organization.

My main focus is on operating system development, low-level performance, and creating tools for the Linux ecosystem.
